Given a [haskell_library](#haskell_library) input, outputs the shared
object file produced as well as the object files it depends on
directly and transitively. This is very useful if you want to link in
a Haskell shared library from `cc_library`.

There is a caveat: this will not provide any shared libraries that
aren't explicitly given to it. This means that if you're using
`prebuilt_dependencies` and relying on GHC to provide those objects,
they will not be present here. You will have to provide those
separately to your `cc_library`. If you're getting
`prebuilt_dependencies` from your toolchain, you will likely want to
extract those and pass them in as well.

"sandwich" (see [bazelbuild/bazel#2163][bazel-cpp-sandwich]) is
